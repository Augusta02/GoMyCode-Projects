With a given integer number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i,i*i) such that a n integral number between 1 and n (both included) and then the program should pribt a dictionary. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program is 8. Then, the output should be: (1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25, 6:36,7:49, 8:64)
y = int(input("Enter a number:"))

m = {y : y*y for y in range(1, y+1)}

print(m)
